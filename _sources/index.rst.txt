MPilot Documentation
====================

MPilot is an extensible environmental modeling framework based on a bottom-up workflow. MPilot is based on the
Environmental Evaluation Modeling System (EEMS), which was initially a fuzzy logic modeling package based on EMDS. The
current version of EEMS is implemented as a collection of MPilot libraries.

This documentation is divided into two high-level sections: **Using MPilot**, intended for modelers and people who need
to run models; and **Developing with MPilot**, intended for programmers who are using MPilot in their Python code, are
creating command libraries for MPilot, or are developing and improving the MPilot software itself.
